Xin is a PhD student in <a href='https://econ.msu.edu/'> **Economics at Michigan State University**</a>. 

She's interested in labor economics, aging workforce dynamics, and the economic impacts of technological change. Her research explores how demographic shifts and technological innovations intersect to shape labor market outcomes across generations. Her dissertation investigates the evolving role of retirement patterns, occupational sorting, and technological adaptation among older workers. Using a combination of empirical methods—including regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, and task-based modeling—I examine how retirement decisions influence intergenerational labor dynamics and fertility outcomes.

Through her research, Xin seeks to inform policy discussions surrounding labor market adaptation to an aging population, technological advancements, and intergenerational equity. (written by ChatGPT4.5 using prompt "write a research statement for personal website.")
